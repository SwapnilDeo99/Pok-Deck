# 🃏 PokéDeck

A fun web application that lets you explore Pokémon cards by type!

## 🔍 How It Works

Enter the number of Pokémon cards you want to view and select a category (type) like **Fire**, **Water**, **Grass**, etc. The app uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display detailed Pokémon cards dynamically — including **images**, **names**, and **stats**.
